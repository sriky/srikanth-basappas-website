Srikanth Basappa is a Software Engineer, currently located in the San Francisco. Ever, since Srikanth played his first computer game ([Tomb Raider Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_Chronicles)) it ignited the fascination and the curiosity to learn and understand how video games are developed. That curiosity and Srikanth's passion for computers led him to study and receive [BSc in Computer Applications](https://christuniversity.in/sciences/computer-science/bachelor-of-computer-applications-(bca)) from [Christ Univerity](https://christuniversity.in/), Bangalore, India, and MSc in Entertainment Software Development from [Sheffield Hallam University](https://www.shu.ac.uk), Sheffield, UK.

[Mass Media Inc.](http://www.massmedia.com), is where Srikanth' career started as a game developer! After working on titles like [Saint's Row 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Row_2) (PlayStation 3), [Damnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation_(video_game)) (PlayStation 3 and Xbox360) and a small stint in casino games, Srikanth career switched, slightly, from a console game developer to mobile game developer when he started working for [Glu Inc](ww.glu.com). The opportunity at Glu was tremendous for Srikanth as he got to work closely with Google on numerous cutting-edge projects while gaining expertise with the Android platform as it matured.

After a 5-year tenure at Glu and shipping numerous titles on Android and Facebook platform, Srikanth started a new journey at an Ed-Tech start-up named [Galxyz](http://galxyz.com/) (pronounced Galaxies). At Galxyz Srikanth is heading the engineering and production of an education based game called [Blue Apprentice](http://blueapprentice.com).
